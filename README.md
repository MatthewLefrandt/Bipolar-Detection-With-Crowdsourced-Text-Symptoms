# Bipolar Disorder Detection using Machine Learning with Shapley Additive Explanations

This repository contains the final versions of the Jupyter notebooks used in our research on detecting bipolar disorder based on crowdsourced text symptoms. The notebooks are:

- **Bipolar_Modelling_final.ipynb**: Contains the final machine learning models for classifying bipolar disorder.
- **Bipolar_Feature_Extraction_final.ipynb**: Performs natural language processing and feature extraction from crowdsourced text data.
